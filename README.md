## Project Overview
This repository contains the HTML and CSS code for a static webpage mimicking the Zomato website's landing page. The page includes a header with navigation, a hero section with a search bar, cards for ordering and dining options, curated restaurant collections, an app download section, and a FAQ section. The design is responsive and visually appealing, with hover effects and a clean layout.

## Features
- **Header Navigation**: Links for app download, investor relations, adding a restaurant, login, and signup.
- **Hero Section**: A backdrop image with a search bar for location-based food and drink discovery.
- **Service Cards**: Options for ordering online, dining, and live events with hover effects.
- **Collections Section**: Curated lists of restaurants with images and descriptions.
- **App Download Section**: Prompts for downloading the Zomato app via email or phone.
- **FAQ Section**: Expandable details for common questions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to smaller screens (below 891px) for mobile compatibility.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including flexbox for layout, hover effects, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **Fonts**: Uses system fonts like Arial, Helvetica, Trebuchet MS, and others for a clean look.
- **Images**: Placeholder images for the backdrop, logos, and card visuals (not included in the repository).

## File Structure
```
zomato-clone/
├── Zomato.html       # Main HTML file for the webpage structure
├── zomato.css        # CSS file for styling the webpage
└── README.md         # This file, documenting the project
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zomato-clone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd zomato-clone
   ```
3. Open `Zomato.html` in a web browser to view the webpage.

**Note**: Ensure you have the necessary image assets (e.g., backdrop, logos, card images) in the same directory as `Zomato.html`, or update the image paths in the HTML/CSS files accordingly.

## Usage
- Open `Zomato.html` in a web browser to view the static webpage.
- Interact with the search bar, hover over cards to see scaling effects, and expand the FAQ section.
- Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window or using a mobile device.

## Responsive Design
The webpage is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices:
- On screens smaller than 891px, the search bar and hero section adjust to fit the screen width.
- The layout uses flexbox to ensure elements like cards and navigation adapt to different screen sizes.
